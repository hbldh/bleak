* Attempted fix of #255 and #133: cleanups, disposing of objects and creating new ``BleakBridge`` instances each disconnect.
* Fixed some type hints and docstrings.
* Modified the ``connected_peripheral_delegate`` handling in macOS backend to fix #213 and #116.
* Merged #270, fixing a critical bug in ``get_services`` method in Core Bluetooth backend.
* Improved handling of disconnections and ``is_connected`` in BlueZ backend to fix #259.

`0.7.1`_ (2020-07-02)
=====================

Changed
-------

* Improved, more explanatory error on BlueZ backend when ``BleakClient`` cannot find the desired device when trying to connect. (#238)
* Better-than-nothing documentation about scanning filters added (#230).
* Ran black on code which was forgotten in 0.7.0. Large diffs due to that.
* Re-adding Python 3.8 CI "tests" on Windows again.

Fixed
-----

* Fix when characteristic updates value faster than asyncio schedule (#240 & #241)
* Incorrect ``MANIFEST.in`` corrected. (#244)


`0.7.0`_ (2020-06-30)
=====================

Added
-----

* Better feedback of communication errors to user in .NET backend and implementing error details proposed in #174.
* Two devices example file to use for e.g. debugging.
* Detection/discovery callbacks in Core Bluetooth backend ``Scanner`` implemented.
* Characteristic handle printout in ``service_explorer.py``.
* Added scanning filters to .NET backend's ``discover`` method.

Changed
-------

* Replace ``NSRunLoop`` with dispatch queue in Core Bluetooth backend. This causes callbacks to be dispatched on a
  background thread instead of on the main dispatch queue on the main thread. ``call_soon_threadsafe()`` is used to synchronize the events
  with the event loop where the central manager was created. Fixes #111.
* The Central Manager is no longer global in the Core Bluetooth backend. A new one is created for each
  ``BleakClient`` and ``BleakScanner``. Fixes #206 and #105.
* Merged #167 and reworked characteristics handling in Bleak. Implemented in all backends;
  bleak now uses the characteristics' handle to identify and keep track of them.
  Fixes #139 and #159 and allows connection for devices with multiple instances
  of the same characteristic UUIDs.
* In ``requirements.txt`` and ``Pipfile``, the requirement on ``pythonnet``
  was bumped to version 2.5.1, which seems to solve issues described in #217 and #225.
* Renamed ``HISTORY.rst`` to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and adopted
  the `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`_ format.
* Python 3.5 support from macOS is officially removed since pyobjc>6 requires 3.6+
* Pin ``pyobjc`` dependencies to use at least version 6.2. (PR #194)
* Pin development requirement on `bump2version` to version 1.0.0
* Added ``.pyup.yml`` for Pyup
* Using CBManagerState constants from pyobj instead of integers.

Removed
-------

* Removed documentation note about not using new event loops in Linux. This was fixed by #143.
* ``_central_manager_delegate_ready`` was removed in macOS backend.
* Removed the ``bleak.backends.bluez.utils.get_gatt_service_path`` method. It is not used by
  bleak and possibly generates errors.

Fixed
-----

* Improved handling of the txdbus connection to avoid hanging of disconnection
  clients in BlueZ backend. Fixes #216, #219 & #221.
* #150 hints at the device path not being possible to create as is done in the `get_device_object_path` method.
  Now, we try to get it from BlueZ first. Otherwise, use the old fallback.
* Minor documentation errors corrected.
* ``CBManagerStatePoweredOn`` is now properly handled in Core Bluetooth.
* Device enumeration in ``discover``and ``Scanner`` corrected. Fixes #211
* Updated documentation about scanning filters.
* Added workaround for ``isScanning`` attribute added in macOS 10.13. Fixes #234.
