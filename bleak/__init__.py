class BleakScanner:
    """
    Interface for Bleak Bluetooth LE Scanners.

    The scanner will listen for BLE advertisements, optionally filtering on advertised services or
    other conditions, and collect a list of :class:`BLEDevice` objects. These can subsequently be used to
    connect to the corresponding BLE server.

    A :class:`BleakScanner` can be used as an asynchronous context manager in which case it automatically
    starts and stops scanning.

    Args:
        detection_callback:
            Optional function that will be called each time a device is
            discovered or advertising data has changed.
        service_uuids:
            Optional list of service UUIDs to filter on. Only advertisements
            containing this advertising data will be received. Required on
            macOS >= 12.0, < 12.3 (unless you create an app with ``py2app``).
        scanning_mode:
            Set to ``"passive"`` to avoid the ``"active"`` scanning mode.
            Passive scanning is not supported on macOS! Will raise
            :class:`BleakError` if set to ``"passive"`` on macOS.
        bluez:
            Dictionary of arguments specific to the BlueZ backend.
        cb:
            Dictionary of arguments specific to the CoreBluetooth backend.
        backend:
            Used to override the automatically selected backend (i.e. for a
            custom backend).
        **kwargs:
            Additional args for backwards compatibility.

    .. tip:: The first received advertisement in ``detection_callback`` may or
        may not include scan response data if the remote device supports it.
        Be sure to take this into account when handing the callback. For example,
        the scan response often contains the local name of the device so if you
        are matching a device based on other data but want to display the local
        name to the user, be sure to wait for ``adv_data.local_name is not None``.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.15
        ``detection_callback``, ``service_uuids`` and ``scanning_mode`` are no longer keyword-only.
        Added ``bluez`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18

        Added ``backend`` parameter.

    """The Client interface for connecting to a specific BLE GATT server and communicating with it.

    A BleakClient can be used as an asynchronous context manager in which case it automatically
    connects and disconnects.

    How many BLE connections can be active simultaneously, and whether connections can be active while
    scanning depends on the Bluetooth adapter hardware.

        address_or_ble_device:
            A :class:`BLEDevice` received from a :class:`BleakScanner` or a
            Bluetooth address (device UUID on macOS).
        disconnected_callback:
            Callback that will be scheduled in the event loop when the client is
            disconnected. The callable must take one argument, which will be
            this client object.
        services:
            Optional list of services to filter. If provided, only these services
            will be resolved. This may or may not reduce the time needed to
            enumerate the services depending on if the OS supports such filtering
            in the Bluetooth stack or not (should affect Windows and Mac).
            These can be 16-bit or 128-bit UUIDs.
        timeout:
            Timeout in seconds passed to the implicit ``discover`` call when
            ``address_or_ble_device`` is not a :class:`BLEDevice`. Defaults to 10.0.
        pair:
            Attempt to pair with the the device before connecting, if it is not
            already paired. This has no effect on macOS since pairing is initiated
            automatically when accessing a characteristic that requires authentication.
            In rare cases, on other platforms, it might be necessary to pair the
            device first in order to be able to even enumerate the services during
            the connection process.
        winrt:
            Dictionary of WinRT/Windows platform-specific options.
        backend:
            Used to override the automatically selected backend (i.e. for a
            custom backend).
        **kwargs:
            Additional keyword arguments for backwards compatibility.

    .. tip:: If you enable pairing with the ``pair`` argument, you will also
        want to extend the timeout to allow enough time for the user to find
        and enter the PIN code on the device, if required.

    .. warning:: Although example code frequently initializes :class:`BleakClient`
        with a Bluetooth address for simplicity, it is not recommended to do so
        for more complex use cases. There are several known issues with providing
        a Bluetooth address as the ``address_or_ble_device`` argument.

        1.  macOS does not provide access to the Bluetooth address for privacy/
            security reasons. Instead it creates a UUID for each Bluetooth
            device which is used in place of the address on this platform.
        2.  Providing an address or UUID instead of a :class:`BLEDevice` causes
            the :meth:`connect` method to implicitly call :meth:`BleakScanner.discover`.
            This is known to cause problems when trying to connect to multiple
            devices at the same time.

        There are two possible kinds of writes. *Write with response* (sometimes
        called a *Request*) will write the data then wait for a response from
        the remote device. *Write without response* (sometimes called *Command*)
        will queue data to be written and return immediately.

        Each characteristic may support one kind or the other or both or neither.
        Consult the device's documentation or inspect the properties of the
        characteristic to find out which kind of writes are supported.

                ``False``, a write-without-response operation will be used.
                Omitting the argument is deprecated and may raise a warning.
                If this arg is omitted, the default behavior is to check the
                characteristic properties to see if the "write" property is
                present. If it is, a write-with-response operation will be
                used. Note: some devices may incorrectly report or omit the
