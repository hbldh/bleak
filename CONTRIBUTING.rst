Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``bleak`` for local development.

You will need `Git <https://git-scm.com>`_ and `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_
and your favorite text editor. And Python of course.

1. Fork the ``bleak`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com:your_name_here/bleak.git

3. Set up the Python environment::

    $ cd bleak/
    $ poetry install

4. Create a branch for local development, originating from the ``develop`` branch::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature develop

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting and the tests::

    $ poetry run black .
    $ poetry run flake8
    $ poetry run pytest

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
2. Modify the ``CHANGELOG.rst``, describing your changes as is specified by the
   guidelines in that document.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.7+ on the following platforms:
    - Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) and greater
    - Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
    - OS X / macOS >= 10.11
4. Squash all your commits on your PR branch, if the commits are not solving
   different problems and you are committing them in the same PR. In that case,
   consider making several PRs instead.
5. Feel free to add your name as a contributor to the ``AUTHORS.rst`` file!
