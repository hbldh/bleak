### Description

Describe what you were trying to get done.
Tell us what happened, what went wrong, and what you expected to happen.

### What I Did

It is preferable if an issue contains a [Miminal Workable Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
This will otherwise be one of the first questions you will get as a response.

It is also preferable if that example is not dependent on a specific peripheral device, but can be run and
reproduced with other BLE peripherals as well.

```
Paste the command(s) you ran and the output.
If there was a crash, please include the traceback here as well.
```

### Logs

Include any relevant logs here.

Logs are essential to understand what is going on behind the scenes.

See https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html for information on how to collect debug logs.

If you receive an OS error (`WinError`, `BleakDBusError`, `NSError`, etc.), Wireshark logs of Bluetooth packets are required to understand the issue!
