Stable release
--------------

To install bleak, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install bleak

This is the preferred method to install bleak, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

Develop branch
--------------

The develop branch can also be installed using ``pip``. This is useful for
testing the latest changes before they reach the stable release.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip
