Troubleshooting
===============

When things don't seem to be working right, here are some things to try.

---------------
Common Mistakes
---------------

Many people name their first script ```bleak.py``. This causes the script to
crash with an ``ImportError`` similar to::

    ImportError: cannot import name 'BleakClient' from partially initialized module 'bleak' (most likely due to a circular import) (bleak.py)`

To fix the error, change the name of the script to something other than ``bleak.py``.


--------------
Enable Logging
--------------

The easiest way to enable logging is to set the ``BLEAK_LOGGING`` environment variable.
Setting the variable depends on what type of terminal you are using.

Posix (Linux, macOS, Cygwin, etc.)::

    export BLEAK_LOGGING=1

Power Shell::

    $env:BLEAK_LOGGING=1

Windows Command Prompt::

    set BLEAK_LOGGING=1

Then run your Python script in the same terminal.


-----------------------------------------------
Connecting to multiple devices at the same time
-----------------------------------------------

If you're having difficulty connecting to multiple devices, try to do a scan first and
pass the returned ``BLEDevice`` objects to ``BleakClient`` calls.

Python::

    import asyncio
    from typing import Sequence

    from bleak import BleakClient, BleakScanner
    from bleak.backends.device import BLEDevice


    async def find_all_devices_services()
        scanner = BleakScanner()
        devices: Sequence[BLEDevice] = scanner.discover(timeout=5.0)
        for d in devices:
            async with BleakClient(d) as client:
                print(await client.get_services())


    asyncio.run(find_all_devices_services())


-----------------------------------------
Pass more parameters to a notify callback
-----------------------------------------

If you need a way to pass more parameters to the notify callback, please use
``functools.partial`` to pass in more arguments.

Issue #759 might fix this in the future.

Python::

    from functools import partial

    from bleak import BleakClient


    def my_notification_callback_with_client_input(
        client: BleakClient, sender: int, data: bytearray
    ):
        """Notification callback with client awareness"""
        print(
            f"Notification from device with address {client.address} and characteristic with handle {client.services.get_characteristic(sender)}. Data: {data}"
        )

    # [...]

    await client.start_notify(
        char_specifier, partial(my_notification_callback_with_client_input, client)
    )

Capture Bluetooth Traffic
-------------------------

Sometimes it can be helpful to see what is actually going over the air between
the OS and the Bluetooth device. There are tools available to capture HCI packets
and decode them.

Windows 10
==========

There is a Windows hardware developer package that includes a tool that supports
capturing Bluetooth traffic directly in Wireshark.

Install
-------

1. Download and install `Wireshark`_.
2. Download and install `the BTP software package`_.

Capture
-------

To capture Bluetooth traffic:

1.  Open a terminal as Administrator.

    * Search start menu for ``cmd``. (Powershell and Windows Terminal are fine too.)
    * Right-click *Command Prompt* and select *Run as Administrator*.

      .. image:: images/win-10-start-cmd-as-admin.png
        :height: 200px
        :alt: Screenshot of Windows Start Menu showing Command Prompt selected
              and context menu with Run as Administrator selected.

2.  Run ``C:\BTP\v1.9.0\x86\btvs.exe``. This should automatically start Wireshark
    in capture mode.

    .. tip:: The version needs to match the installed version. ``v1.9.0`` was
             the current version at the time this was written. Additionally,
             ``C:`` may not be the root drive on some systems.

3.  Run your Python script in a different terminal (not as Administrator) to reproduce
    the problem.

4.  Click the stop button in Wireshark to stop the capture.

.. _the BTP software package: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/testing-btp-software-package


macOS
=====

On macOS, special software is required to capture and view Bluetooth traffic.
You will need to sign up for an Apple Developer account to obtain this software.

1.  Go to `<https://developer.apple.com/download/more/>`_ and download *Additional
    Tools for Xcode ...* where ... is the Xcode version corresponding to your macOS
    version (e.g. 12 for Big Sur, 11 for Mojave, etc.).

2.  Open the disk image and in the *Hardware* folder, double-click the *PacketLogger.app*
    to run it.

3.  Click the *Clear* button in the toolbar to clear the old data.

4.  Run your Python script to reproduce the problem.

5.  Click the *Stop* button in the toolbar to stop the capture.

.. tip:: The Bluetooth traffic can be viewed in the *PacketLogger.app* or it can
         be saved to a file and viewed in `Wireshark`_.


Linux
=====

On Linux, `Wireshark`_ can be used to capture and view Bluetooth traffic.

1.  Install Wireshark. Most distributions include a ``wireshark`` package. For
    example, on Debian/Ubuntu based distributions::

        sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark

2.  Start Wireshark and select your Bluetooth adapter, then start a capture.

    .. tip:: Visit the `Wireshark Wiki`_ for help with configuring permissions
             and making sure proper drivers are installed.

3.  Run your Python script to reproduce the problem.

4.  Click the stop button in Wireshark to stop the capture.

Handling OS Caching of BLE Device Services
------------------------------------------

If you develop your own BLE peripherals, and frequently change services, characteristics and/or descriptors, then
Bleak might report outdated versions of your peripheral's services due to OS level caching. The caching is done to
speed up the connections with peripherals where services do not change and is enabled by default on most operating
systems and thus also in Bleak.

There are ways to avoid this on different backends though, and if you experience these kinds of problems, the steps
below might help you to circumvent the caches.


macOS
=====

The OS level caching handling on macOS has not been explored yet.


Linux
=====

When you change the structure of services/characteristics on a device, you have to remove the device from
BlueZ so that it will read everything again. Otherwise BlueZ gives the cached values from the first time
the device was connected. You can use the ``bluetoothctl`` command line tool to do this:

.. code-block:: shell

    bluetoothctl -- remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    # prior to BlueZ 5.62 you also need to manually delete the GATT cache
    sudo rm "/var/lib/bluetooth/YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY/cache/XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

...where ``XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`` is the Bluetooth address of your device and
``YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY`` is the Bluetooth address of the Bluetooth adapter on
your computer.
